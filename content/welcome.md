### Specalyzer

Specalyzer is a web application for interactive analysis of spectral reflectance data. Follow the upload instructions below by using the upload menu to the left. Once the data is uploaded, use the navigation bar above to filter, analyse and export your data.

### Upload instructions

Use the sidebar menu to the left to upload your spectral, phenotype/attribute and fieldmap data. An example data set is provided at the bottom of this page to help you acquaint yourself with the file formats used by Specalyzer and to let you preview the application's features.

#### Spectral data

Your spectral data should be uploaded as separate uniquely named files, where each file contains a separate spectral measurement. Specalyzer currently supports four formats: Spectrawiz (.TRM), ASD binary (.ASD), comma-delimited long and wide-form data.

#### Attribute data

Attribute data should be uploaded as a tab-separated table where each of the rows correspond to the uploaded spectral measurements, and where columns correspond to attributes. The first column in the attribute data table should be a column called 'filename' (without the quotes) that specifies the filename (including the file-ending) of the spectral measurements that corresponds to the current attribute data row.

#### Fieldmap data

The fieldmap data should be one more more comma-delimited matrices that specify the spatial layout of spectral measurements as they were collected in a field trial (if applicable). The spectral measurements are specified by their filenames, but without the file-endings.

### Data privacy

All uploaded user data is erased from the server 24 hours after the time of upload.
